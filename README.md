# Ape-Fight-Club

Welcome to the Ape-Fight-Club, where your knowledge and intuition can earn you ape coins! Below you will find the instructions and rules on how to participate and win.

## How to Participate

1. **Entry Fee**: To join a fight-club, send 100 ape coins to the designated fight-club address.
2. **Confirmation**: Once your transaction is confirmed, you are entered into the pot.
3. **Fight-Club Initiation**: A fight-club begins when at least two participants have entered the pot.
4. **Countdown**: A 5-minute countdown starts as soon as the fight-club opens.

## The Game

1. **Question**: At the end of the countdown, an oracle presents a numerical question. Example: "How far is the moon right now from the closest point on Earthâ€™s surface in km?"
2. **Submitting Guesses**: You have 15 seconds to submit your guess. This short window prevents cheating.
3. **Guess Evaluation**:
   - All guesses are arranged from lowest to highest.
   - Guesses are converted to a logarithmic scale for fair comparison.
   - Example: If the actual distance is 400,000 km, a guess of 800,000 km is closer logarithmically than 100 km.

## Determining the Winners

1. **Logarithmic Comparison**: The correct answer is shown on the logarithmic scale.
2. **Closest Guesses**: The guess that is logarithmically closest to the correct answer wins the pot.
3. **Distribution of Pot**:
   - **1st Place**: Closest guess wins the pot.
   - **2nd Place**: Second closest guess wins 20% of the pot.
   - **3rd Place**: Third closest guess wins 10% of the pot.
   - **4th Place**: Fourth closest guess wins 5% of the pot.
   - The distribution follows a Gaussian pattern, rewarding proximity to the correct answer.

## Summary

- **Entry Fee**: 100 ape coins.
- **Minimum Participants**: 2.
- **Countdown**: 5 minutes.
- **Guess Submission Time**: 15 seconds.
- **Logarithmic Comparison**: Ensures fair assessment.
